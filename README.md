More to come once the awesome is initialized!

### Idea

Imagine a newspaper completely fit for you. The Social Times is an online newssite that fetches your Twitter information and analyses the relevance of links shared by those who you follow. This way, we provide you with the best possible articles matching your interests in a clean overview. Done with losing time by clicking all the links individually! All the information is structured in a user-friendly way on one page.

Perfectly to stay up-to-date with the latest news that really matters.
